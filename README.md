# Purpose of project
The purpose of this project is to revolutionize music recommendation systems by integrating neuroscience and artificial intelligence to create playlists that respond to real-time emotional states. Unlike traditional recommendation models that rely on listening history and genre preferences, *Mind Beats* leverages Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology to analyze EEG signals and determine a user's mood with high accuracy. By doing so, it aims to break the restrictive feedback loops of conventional algorithms and instead offer a deeply personalized listening experience that enhances positive emotions and alleviates negative ones. This innovation not only redefines how music is consumed but also explores its potential as a tool for emotional well-being, paving the way for future advancements in neuro-adaptive technology.

# Tools utilized
Streamlit, OpenAI, Muse

# Problem and how you overcame
One of the biggest challenges was accurately interpreting EEG signals and mapping them to emotional states given our lack of experience with neuroscience. We spent a lot of time reading and researching to accurately understand EEG Signals and overcome this challenge.
